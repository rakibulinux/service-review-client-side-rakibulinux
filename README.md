## Project Description:

I have created Order Review project using npx create-react-app b6a11-service-review-client-side-rakibulinux and then install some npm packages like react-router, react-hot-toast, firebase, lottie-react, react-icons, react-router-dom, and react-to-pdf, to make my work perfect. Then created some components inside of the components folder also added a router file inside of the Routers folder. After this I focused on my API load and firebase authentication work. API loaded via react-router loader also used react context API to make my work faster.
